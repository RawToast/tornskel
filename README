GETTING STARTED
---------------

You'll need to create a settings_dev.py or settings_prod.py in order to run
tornskel.  The easiest way to do this is to copy settings_dev.py.template to
settings_dev.py.

Once you have your local settings created, check out the options to launch.py
as follows.

	tornskel(master)$ ./launch.py -h
	Usage: launch.py [options]

	Options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -r, --routes          print list of routes
	  -p PORT, --port=PORT  specify httpd port

If you just execute `./launch.py`, a Tornado instance will be running at the
port specified under httpd_port in settings.py or settings_dev.py if you
editted that.
